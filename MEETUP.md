La gamification dans une entreprise SaaS - table ronde

D-EDGE organise un Hackathon interne sur le th√®me de la Gamification. Comme ce sujet est loin de notre activit√© quotidienne et que les pi√®ges sont nombreux, nous avons d√©cid√© d'ouvrir la discussion lors d'un Meetup. Rejoignez Alois, Arthur, Aur√©lien et Simone pour une table ronde sur ce sujet sensible !

Tout le monde pourra poser une question ou participer !
Cependant, nous pr√©voyons d'aborder au moins ces questions :
- Quels sont les √©l√©ments cl√©s de la gamification ?
- La gamification doit-elle rimer avec manipulation ?
- A faire et √† ne pas faire, exemples et suggestions
- Qui peut b√©n√©ficier de la gamification ?

## D-EDGE Tech Meetup #10 - Docker, CI/CD and Kubernetes: A real-world example

[![thumbnail](https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/8N4srFqsvJI/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8N4srFqsvJI)

Docker, docker-compose, CI/CD, Kubernetes are some of the new tools and concepts popular in back-end development these days.
Tons of online resources are available to use the tools individually.

But how to make them work together?

In this D-EDGE Tech Meetup, David will show you how to get the most out of these tools together with a concrete example from his daily work.
All developers are welcome (junior and senior), mainly back-end developers.

## D-EDGE Tech Meetup #9 - SCRUM is a product management framework (and not a project management tool)

SCRUM is now one of the most well-known project management tools. But what if I told you Scrum is not a project management tool, but rather a framework obsessed with one thing: delivering more value to you or your customers? How would that change your daily life with dreary daily and painful sprint plannings? This talk is for everybody that has to work with Scrum, but may especially be useful for those having actual (and probably painful) experience with it without knowing exactly what it's made of.



## D-EDGE Tech Meetup #8 - Splitting the view and the brains in JS ‚Äî state machines with XState (FR)

[![thumbnail](https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/yRB57CDvQuY/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRB57CDvQuY)

In this Meetup, Aur√©lien will focus on:

* what are finite state machines and how to use them
* the XState library
* an example of a Login screen in React, using XState

The concept of a state machine can be fairly complex so it is suggested that you have good knowledge of Javascript and frontend development. If you want to be comfortable, you can read some documentation prior to the Meetup:

- What are state machines?
- The XState documentation page: [xstate.js.org/](http://xstate.js.org/)
- You can even play around with this very good education game on state machines: [https://mastery.games/post/state-machines-in-react/](https://mastery.games/post/state-machines-in-react/)

It's been over a year of full remote work for us at D-EDGE. One day we were at the office, and the next we were all working from home. We've all experienced the situation, shifting from excitement to nostalgia and back.
But with everything we've set up, before and during this pandemic, the after is going to be game-changing! Are you ready for a new beginning of remote working?
In this meetup, open to every curious mind, we'll discuss:
* üéõ the remote manifesto
* üôÇ the successes we faced when switching to full remote
* üôÉ... and the failures we've learned from
* üåà how we see the after pandemic remote
We'll share tips that you can start implementing at your company

Monads are all the rage in FP land, but Applicatives, despite lack of love can help and save In Real Life situation. We'll learn to recognize them and use them, then with three examples will see how far Applicatives can help. All developers are welcome, no specific level of experience is required.

Were you also confronted with legacy code? Legacy code is a problem faced by all developers, especially in growing teams. During this Meetup, Santiago, Software Engineer, will discuss:
* what legacy code is
* how to change it
* one way he has found to integrate a new shiny web stack into an old-fashioned one

## D-EDGE Tech Meetup #4 - A personal guide to Stack Overflow (in French)

[![thumbnail](https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/y1EFsgDBEus/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1EFsgDBEus)

As aspiring Software Craftsmen, we are raising the bar of professional software development by practising it and helping others learn the craft. One of the resources developers use the most is Stack Overflow. SO is a Q&A website for programmers. We often use it silently though, like a database. We lurk and copy/paste answers without contributing directly to it.

With Alois, you'll see how to leverage this resource to improve your day-to-day work:
- how does Stack Overflow work?
- how to post a question?
- how to answer a question?
Alois will mostly talk about his own experience on Stack Overflow as a user, contributor and moderator.
No specific experience of Stack Overflow is required and, all the programmers are welcome whatever your main language is and whatever your experience is.

## D-EDGE Tech Meetup #2 - Remote onboarding of developers

[![thumbnail](https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/IZNDQ83DrTY/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZNDQ83DrTY)

We all know someone who arrived in a company during the lockdown. While this was an exceptional situation in most locations, the home office is now becoming the new normal. In a growing tech company that needs new resources on a regular basis, it was essential to rethink the onboarding of new developers. During this Meetup, we will see what they can expect when they join a new structure without even setting foot in it...

During this Meetup, Aurelien will address:
- How remote onboarding of developers is organised
- How new developers live this experience, through several feedbacks
- But also, how can tech helps in this process be it with tools, best practices, and agility that facilitate remote teamwork and management.

[![thumbnail](https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/lcuTJYw-jsw/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcuTJYw-jsw)

Functional CSS is the practice of using small, immutable and explicitly named utility classes to construct components. During this one-hour meet up (in French), let's figure out how applying the functional paradigm to CSS will help us manage the growth of our codebase.
Together, we will see:
* What is CSS?
* What is Functional CSS?
* How can I use it?

In recent years, functional programming has become more and more popular. Let's look at one of the best approaches to develop a UI application in the functional paradigm:
* A little of history
* MVU pattern
* SAFE Stack in practice
