Functional CSS is the practice of using small, immutable and explicitly named utility classes to construct components. During this one-hour meet up (in French), let's figure out how applying the functional paradigm to CSS will help us manage the growth of our codebase.
Together, we will see:
* What is CSS?
* What is Functional CSS?
* How can I use it?

In recent years, functional programming has become more and more popular. Let's look at one of the best approaches to develop a UI application in the functional paradigm:
* A little of history
* MVU pattern
* SAFE Stack in practice

## D EDGE Tech Meetup #2 - Remote onboarding of developers

We all know someone who arrived in a company during the lockdown. While this was an exceptional situation in most locations, the home office is now becoming the new normal. In a growing tech company that needs new resources on a regular basis, it was essential to rethink the onboarding of new developers. During this Meetup, we will see what they can expect when they join a new structure without even setting foot in it...

During this Meetup, Aurelien will address:
- How remote onboarding of developers is organised
- How new developers live this experience, through several feedbacks
- But also, how can tech helps in this process be it with tools, best practices, and agility that facilitate remote teamwork and management.

## D-EDGE Tech Meetup #4 - A personal guide to Stack Overflow (in French)

<!-- [![thumbnail](https://img.youtube.com/vi/y1EFsgDBEus/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1EFsgDBEus) -->

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1EFsgDBEus"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/y1EFsgDBEus/maxresdefault.jpg" width = "259" height="194"></a>

As aspiring Software Craftsmen, we are raising the bar of professional software development by practising it and helping others learn the craft. One of the resources developers use the most is Stack Overflow. SO is a Q&A website for programmers. We often use it silently though, like a database. We lurk and copy/paste answers without contributing directly to it.

With Alois, you'll see how to leverage this resource to improve your day-to-day work:
- how does Stack Overflow work?
- how to post a question?
- how to answer a question?
Alois will mostly talk about his own experience on Stack Overflow as a user, contributor and moderator.
No specific experience of Stack Overflow is required and, all the programmers are welcome whatever your main language is and whatever your experience is.

## D-EDGE Tech Meetup #5 - Integrating shiny new stack into legacy code

<!-- [![thumbnail](https://img.youtube.com/vi/akNGA5mIJN8/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akNGA5mIJN8) -->

Were you also confronted with legacy code? Legacy code is a problem faced by all developers, especially in growing teams. During this Meetup, Santiago, Software Engineer, will discuss:
- what legacy code is
- how to change it
- one way he has found to integrate a new shiny web stack into an old-fashioned one
All developers are welcome, no specific level of experience is required.

## D-EDGE Tech Meetup #6 - Applicative IRL

<!-- [![thumbnail](https://img.youtube.com/vi/a4nYkvAA3VY/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4nYkvAA3VY) -->

Monads are all the rage in FP land, but Applicatives, despite lack of love can help and save In Real Life situation. We'll learn to recognize them and use them, then with three examples will see how far Applicatives can help. All developers are welcome, no specific level of experience is required.

It's been over a year of full remote work for us at D-EDGE. One day we were at the office, and the next we were all working from home. We've all experienced the situation, shifting from excitement to nostalgia and back.
But with everything we've set up, before and during this pandemic, the after is going to be game-changing! Are you ready for a new beginning of remote working?
In this meetup, open to every curious mind, we'll discuss:
ðŸŽ› the remote manifesto
ðŸ™‚ the successes we faced when switching to full remote
ðŸ™ƒ... and the failures we've learned from
ðŸŒˆ how we see the after pandemia remote
We'll share tips that you can start implementing at your company


## D-EDGE Meetup #8 - Splitting the view and the brains in JS â€” state machines with XState (in French)

<!-- [![thumbnail](https://img.youtube.com/vi/yRB57CDvQuY/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRB57CDvQuY) -->

In this Meetup, AurÃ©lien will focus on:

- what are finite state machines and how to use them
- the XState library
- an example of a Login screen in React, using XState

The concept of a state machine can be fairly complex so it is suggested that you have good knowledge of Javascript and frontend development.
