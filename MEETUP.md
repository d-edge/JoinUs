[![thumbnail](https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/CR2Sw6hz5Mc/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR2Sw6hz5Mc)

Today, we can work from almost anywhere: home, the office, a shack by the beach, or a chalet in the mountains for some lucky ones... But is our work setup sustainable and healthy? Do you sometimes feel tired or uncomfortable after a day sitting at your desk?

As we spend most of our working hours - and some free time - in front of a computer, ergonomics is key.

In this meetup, BenoÃ®t will review the concerns related to our workspace (sitting position, screens, input devices, ...) and give you his tips to create a good working environment and preserve your health.

Everyone is welcome to attend this meetup. There is no specific background required.

## Tech Meetup #13 - Observability vs traditional monitoring: the reasons why you need OpenTelemetry

With increasingly complex systems and use cases traversing multiple services and systems, traditional logging is no longer sufficient to understand everything that is happening in a system and, more importantly, to debug a problem in that system.
This is where OpenTelemetry comes in and offers an easy way to instrument your codebase for data collection and make adjustments as the organization grows.

In this Meetup, Santiago will show you how you can debug almost anything thanks to OpenTelemetry:

* Observability vs traditional monitoring
* Why observability
* Where does OTel fit into this?
* OTel example on dotnet

All developers are welcome to attend. No specific language or background is required.

## D-EDGE Tech Meetup #12 - #NOMEMALLOC

[![thumbnail](https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/eVJ5b1lwMJ8/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVJ5b1lwMJ8)

Functional languages have a bad reputation of allocating memory like crazy. But F#, built on .Net core, has many constructs to write code that make no allocation, as we could do in C or Rust. We'll explore Span 't , Memory 't , IsByRefLike in a F# idiomatic and functional way by writing a simple Video decoder that makes #NoMemAlloc.

This Meetup is aimed at developers with a good level in C# or F# (.Net developers) who want to work on the performance of their apps.

## Tech Meetup #11 - Gamification: the Good, the Bad, and the COVID (an open discussion in French)

La gamification dans une entreprise SaaS - table ronde

D-EDGE organise un Hackathon interne sur le thÃ¨me de la Gamification. Comme ce sujet est loin de notre activitÃ© quotidienne et que les piÃ¨ges sont nombreux, nous avons dÃ©cidÃ© d'ouvrir la discussion lors d'un Meetup. Rejoignez Alois, Arthur, AurÃ©lien et Simone pour une table ronde sur ce sujet sensible !

Tout le monde pourra poser une question ou participer !
Cependant, nous prÃ©voyons d'aborder au moins ces questions :
- Quels sont les Ã©lÃ©ments clÃ©s de la gamification ?
- La gamification doit-elle rimer avec manipulation ?
- A faire et Ã  ne pas faire, exemples et suggestions
- Qui peut bÃ©nÃ©ficier de la gamification ?

## D-EDGE Tech Meetup #10 - Docker, CI/CD and Kubernetes: A real-world example

[![thumbnail](https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/8N4srFqsvJI/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8N4srFqsvJI)

Docker, docker-compose, CI/CD, Kubernetes are some of the new tools and concepts popular in back-end development these days.
Tons of online resources are available to use the tools individually.

But how to make them work together?

In this D-EDGE Tech Meetup, David will show you how to get the most out of these tools together with a concrete example from his daily work.
All developers are welcome (junior and senior), mainly back-end developers.

## D-EDGE Tech Meetup #9 - SCRUM is a product management framework (and not a project management tool)

[![thumbnail](https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/s1rLEOBhS_4/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1rLEOBhS_4)

SCRUM is now one of the most well-known project management tools. But what if I told you Scrum is not a project management tool, but rather a framework obsessed with one thing: delivering more value to you or your customers? How would that change your daily life with dreary daily and painful sprint plannings? This talk is for everybody that has to work with Scrum, but may especially be useful for those having actual (and probably painful) experience with it without knowing exactly what it's made of.



## D-EDGE Tech Meetup #8 - Splitting the view and the brains in JS â€” state machines with XState (FR)

[![thumbnail](https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/yRB57CDvQuY/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRB57CDvQuY)

In this Meetup, AurÃ©lien will focus on:

* what are finite state machines and how to use them
* the XState library
* an example of a Login screen in React, using XState

The concept of a state machine can be fairly complex so it is suggested that you have good knowledge of Javascript and frontend development. If you want to be comfortable, you can read some documentation prior to the Meetup:

- What are state machines?
- The XState documentation page: [xstate.js.org/](http://xstate.js.org/)
- You can even play around with this very good education game on state machines: [https://mastery.games/post/state-machines-in-react/](https://mastery.games/post/state-machines-in-react/)

## D-EDGE Tech Meetup #7 - Remote: the new normal in post-pandemic times

[![thumbnail](https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/Bzg0ZVeIh6Y/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bzg0ZVeIh6Y)

It's been over a year of full remote work for us at D-EDGE. One day we were at the office, and the next we were all working from home. We've all experienced the situation, shifting from excitement to nostalgia and back.
But with everything we've set up, before and during this pandemic, the after is going to be game-changing! Are you ready for a new beginning of remote working?
In this meetup, open to every curious mind, we'll discuss:
* ðŸŽ› the remote manifesto
* ðŸ™‚ the successes we faced when switching to full remote
* ðŸ™ƒ... and the failures we've learned from
* ðŸŒˆ how we see the after pandemic remote
We'll share tips that you can start implementing at your company



## D-EDGE Tech Meetup #6 - Applicative IRL

[![thumbnail](https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/a4nYkvAA3VY/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4nYkvAA3VY)

Monads are all the rage in FP land, but Applicatives, despite lack of love can help and save In Real Life situation. We'll learn to recognize them and use them, then with three examples will see how far Applicatives can help. All developers are welcome, no specific level of experience is required.

## D-EDGE Tech Meetup #5 -  Integrating shiny new stack into legacy code

[![thumbnail](https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/akNGA5mIJN8/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akNGA5mIJN8)

Were you also confronted with legacy code? Legacy code is a problem faced by all developers, especially in growing teams. During this Meetup, Santiago, Software Engineer, will discuss:
* what legacy code is
* how to change it
* one way he has found to integrate a new shiny web stack into an old-fashioned one

## D-EDGE Tech Meetup #4 - A personal guide to Stack Overflow (in French)

[![thumbnail](https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/y1EFsgDBEus/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1EFsgDBEus)

As aspiring Software Craftsmen, we are raising the bar of professional software development by practising it and helping others learn the craft. One of the resources developers use the most is Stack Overflow. SO is a Q&A website for programmers. We often use it silently though, like a database. We lurk and copy/paste answers without contributing directly to it.

With Alois, you'll see how to leverage this resource to improve your day-to-day work:
- how does Stack Overflow work?
- how to post a question?
- how to answer a question?
Alois will mostly talk about his own experience on Stack Overflow as a user, contributor and moderator.
No specific experience of Stack Overflow is required and, all the programmers are welcome whatever your main language is and whatever your experience is.
